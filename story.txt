Once upon a time there was a cat named Derek. He lived in New York City in 
a modern high rise apartment that looked out over central park. Derek was a 
short fat tabby cat with orange fur who loved to lounge in the sun.

One day, much to Derek's dismay, the neighbors across the hall brought home
a new dog. The dog was extremely energetic and was always announcing his
presence in the building with his constant barking. Derek's once relaxing
mid-day cat naps became a thing of the past and his luxurious Manhattan
lifestyle was suddenly quite stale.

Derek decides to have a meeting with this new neighbor's cat one day. He waited at 
the front door of the apartment in a Sunday afternoon, and he is prepared to 
address his discontentment toward the dog.

His new cat friend Ron opened up, and he immediately started ranting about
the new dog. His friend had to literally shut the door on him, to make him
understand that he wasn't into his friend's ranting. This made him feel very
lonely.
