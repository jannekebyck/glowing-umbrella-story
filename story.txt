Once upon a time there was a cat named Derek. He lived in New York City in 
a modern high rise apartment that looked out over central park. Derek was a 
short fat tabby cat with orange fur who loved to lounge in the sun.

One day, much to Derek's dismay, the neighbors across the hall brought home
a new dog. The dog was extremely energetic and was always announcing his
presence in the building with his constant barking. Derek's once relaxing
mid-day cat naps became a thing of the past and his luxurious Manhattan
lifestyle was suddenly quite stale.
